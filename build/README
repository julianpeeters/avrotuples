The page..
http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Using-Sonatype.html
..served as a reference to cutting releases to Sonatype.

To cut a new release,

1. Update the version in build.sbt
2. Cut a release on the github site
3. Run the command "sbt +publishSigned" (note: the '+' prefix
   means that each version of Scala, defined in crossScalaVersions
   in build.sbt, will be built and published)
4. Run through the Nexus UI close/publish flow at oss.sonatype.org

The publishSigned tasks are provided by the gpg plugin
(see ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins) for the configuration

See ~/.sbt/0.13/sonatype.sbt for Sonatype credential information
